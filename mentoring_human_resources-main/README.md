# Human Resources

## Usage

Create a new file named `.env` in the root folder of the repository. Paste in the contents from the `.example.env` file and fill the values. You can then run the project:

```shell
source .env
docker compose up --build
```

Once your project is up and running, you can access [UI](http://localhost) and [API](http://localhost/api/v1/docs).
